So I'm here -- there's paragraph 8 here.  You see   01:44\n17   we're on page 2?  And after paragraph 8 we no longer have    01:44\n18   any paragraph numbers.  Was that a conscious decision?       01:44\n19       A    That was not a conscious decision.                  01:44\n20       Q    Okay.  It happens.  I'm not trying to give you a    01:44\n21   hard time about it.  I just wondered if there's some         01:44\n22   significance, if like the first part of it was prefatory     01:44\n23   and the rest of it was different somehow, but that was --    01:44\n24   it just is what it is?
