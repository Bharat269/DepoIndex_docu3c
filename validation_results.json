For example,                                         01:38\n14   California State Student Loan Servicing Law I believe has    01:38\n15   requirements about the data that must be transferred from    01:39\n16   one servicer to another in -- in a -- when a transfer        01:39\n17   occurs.  I believe that other states as well, but I don't    01:39\n18   know them off the top of my head.                            01:39\n19       Q    Thank you.                                          01:39\n20            In this case, of course, we're dealing with the     01:39\n21   PEAKS loans that were in use at ITT; correct?                01:39\n22       A    That's correct.                                     01:39\n23       Q    Are you aware of any regulations that were          01:39\n24   violated when the data was transferred by the original       01:39\n25   servicer in this case, the Access Group, to my clients --    01:39\nPage 23\nVeritext Legal Solutions\n866 299-5127"
