**Topic: Loan Servicer Portfolio Transfers**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner asks the witness directly if she has "ever dealt with a situation where one loan servicer takes over a student loan portfolio from another loan servicer" (Q15-18).
    2.  The witness confirms this is a common occurrence, stating, "Yes, that -- that is a frequent occurrence" (A19).
    3.  When asked about the frequency of such events, the witness estimates it has happened "about a dozen times" in the federal student loan context (A22-24).
    4.  She provides a recent example, mentioning that "a number of federal student loan servicers leave. Navient..." (A24-25).

    1.  The examiner asks about the witness's "familiarity" with the RICO statute (Q8-9).
    2.  The witness states she is "generally aware of the RICO statute" (A10-11).
    3.  When asked if she has "ever had a job where you helped determine whether a RICO enterprise existed," she clarifies that in her work as a consumer attorney, she has "been in a position to consider or to work with others who have considered whether or not a RICO violation has occurred" (A12-17).
    4.  She confirms that these instances were in the context of "student loan related cases," which is her "primary area of expertise" (A18-22).
    5.  She quantifies this experience as "A small handful of times. Less than half a dozen" (A23-25).

**Topic: Experience in Criminal Law**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner asks if the witness has "ever had a job related to criminal law" (Q14-15).
    2.  The witness confirms, stating, "Yes. I was an intern at the District Attorney's Office in 2002" (A16-17).
    3.  When asked if this was the extent of her experience, she adds that "tangentially, I have had some experience working with survivors of domestic violence" (A18-21).
    4.  She further mentions that she "volunteered at a teen court when I was an attorney in Rochester" (A22-25).
*   **Conclusion:** The witness's experience in criminal law includes an internship at the District Attorney's Office in 2002, tangential experience working with survivors of domestic violence, and volunteering at a teen court.

**Topic: Expert Report Structure and Content**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner asks if the witness's expert report made any findings about whether there was a RICO enterprise (Q6-8).
    2.  The witness states she "was not asked to provide a legal opinion as to whether or not there was a RICO enterprise" and that it was "outside the scope of my report," indicating no such findings were made (A9-14).
    3.  The examiner then points out a formatting inconsistency in the report: the absence of paragraph numbers after paragraph 8 (Q15-18).
    4.  The witness clarifies that this "was not a conscious decision" (A19).
    5.  The examiner probes if there was any significance to this, suggesting a structural difference, but the witness confirms it was simply an unintentional formatting issue, stating, "That just is what it is" (A20-25).
*   **Conclusion:** The witness's expert report did not include findings on whether a RICO enterprise existed because it was outside the scope of her requested opinion. Additionally, the lack of paragraph numbers after paragraph 8 in her report was an unintentional formatting issue, not a conscious structural decision.

**Topic: ITT's Abusive Practices and Government Oversight**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner refers to the witness's report, specifically page 11, line 6, which discusses "widespread abusive recruiting and financial aid practices" by ITT, referencing reports from 1999 through 2005 (Q8-14).
    2.  The witness confirms this information is in her report (A16).
    3.  The examiner establishes that these issues were "public" (Q17-18, A19).
    4.  The examiner then asks if these documented issues resulted in any court order or governmental agency order preventing entities from doing business with ITT (Q19-22).
    5.  The witness confirms that "ITT remained in business following these events," indicating that no such orders were issued or enforced to stop ITT's operations based on these specific findings (A23-24). The last line suggests the federal government even continued to provide support.
*   **Conclusion:** The witness's report details ITT's publicly known "widespread abusive recruiting and financial aid practices" from 1999-2005. Despite these documented issues, ITT remained in business, and no court or governmental agency issued orders preventing entities from doing business with ITT.

**Topic: Peak Loan Enforceability and Validity**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner confirms that the witness has reviewed materials related to the PEAKS loans (Q13-17).
    2.  The witness asserts her qualification to provide opinions on the materials she reviewed regarding PEAKS loans (Q18-21).
    3.  The examiner then directly asks if the witness believes the PEAKS loans "became invalid and unenforceable" at some point (Q22-23).
    4.  The witness's response is interrupted, but she begins by stating, "So I think that's not quite an accurate description of the legal..." (A24-25). This indicates she does not agree with the premise that the loans simply "became invalid and unenforceable" in the way the question is phrased, suggesting a more nuanced legal perspective.
*   **Conclusion:** The witness has reviewed materials on PEAKS loans and is qualified to offer opinions on them. When asked if she believes PEAKS loans became invalid and unenforceable, her initial response indicates she views that phrasing as not "quite an accurate description of the legal" situation, suggesting a more complex legal analysis is required.

**Topic: Deposition Conclusion**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner, Mr. Purcell, indicates that the deposition is "getting very close to the end" (L4-5).
    2.  He then states, "That's all I've got," signifying the completion of his questioning (L6).
    3.  The court reporter asks to go off the record, which is affirmed by Mr. Purcell (L9-10).
    4.  The videographer formally announces going off the record at 3:42 P.M. and explicitly states that this "concludes today's testimony given by Persis Yu" (L11-13).
    5.  The transcript formally notes the deposition concluded at 3:42 P.M. (L17).

**Topic: Vervent's Involvement with ITT Misrepresentation**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The witness first describes ITT's known practices of "misrepresenting the quality of its education, the value of its degree, the job placement rates," and "the salaries that its former students receive" (L1-4).
    2.  The examiner then directly asks if "any of the Vervent defendants" were "involved in that practice by ITT" or "involved in making those sorts of misrepresentations" (Q14-15, Q18-21).
    3.  The witness states, "I am not aware of the Vervent representatives making the -- those representations themselves" (A22-24).
    4.  However, she immediately qualifies this by adding, "however, they certainly would have been aware of those representations when they were asking students to..." (A24-25), implying indirect knowledge or awareness of ITT's misrepresentations.
*   **Conclusion:** The witness is not aware of Vervent representatives *directly* making misrepresentations about ITT's benefits to students. However, she states that Vervent representatives "certainly would have been aware" of ITT's misrepresentations when interacting with students.

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  The examiner establishes that the witness has never worked *as* or *for* a loan servicer (Q4-7).

    3.  She specifies that she began working in this field in 2009 as a legal aid attorney representing student loan borrowers (Q14-17).
    4.  Her work at the National Consumer Law Center directly involved student loan servicing through "researching laws related to servicing," "reviewing contracts," and preparing RFI comments (Q18-25).

**Topic: ITT Degree Value and Outlier Cases**

*   **Chain of Thought:**
    1.  Following a recess, the examiner returns to the topic of the benefits of an ITT degree (Q23-24).
    2.  The examiner proposes that if someone *did* get a job after attending ITT, it would be considered an "outlier" (Q25-Page 38 L2).
    3.  The witness agrees with this assessment, stating, "I would say that that is an outlier" (A3-4).
    4.  The examiner then asks if it's fair to say an ITT degree had "little to no value" (Q5-6).
    5.  The witness again agrees, stating, "I would say that that is a fair statement" (A7-8).
    6.  Finally, when asked if she knows of any ITT graduates who got jobs, the witness states, "I do not" (Q9-11).
*   **Conclusion:** The witness believes that an ITT degree generally had "little to no value." She considers instances of ITT graduates successfully obtaining jobs to be "outliers" and states she does not personally know of any ITT graduates who secured employment.
